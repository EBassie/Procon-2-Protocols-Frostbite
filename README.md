## About Procon Potato ##
Procon Potato is a free remote control (RCON) tool for gameservers, currently supporting Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, Medal of Honor: Warfighter and Battlefield 4. It is developed by [Myrcon Ptd. Ltd.](https://myrcon.com "Official homepage of Myrcon Ptd. Ltd.") and also available as open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/Myrcon/Procon-2 "Procon Potato on GitHub").

In addition to providing basic features to control your gameserver, users can extend Procon's functionality using plugins, which can control Procon's behavior and add additional possibilities for gameserver admins. Furthermore, Procon Potato provides a layer system, which allows running plugins and managing admin accounts in a central location instead of distributing it to every admin connected to the gameserver.

### About Frostbite Protocol ###
In order to connect to various gameservers, Procon Potato requires the implementation of the gameserver's RCON protocol. These protocols are developed independently from the Procon Potato Core and are distributed separately. A separate repository for the protocols for Frostbite-based games has been created to ease in development.
